        <h5>Student & Frontend Developer</h5><br>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Angelica Padilla, a passionate student with a keen interest in frontend development.
          Currently pursuing Information Technology at PHINMA - University of Pangasinan, I am on a journey to 
          merge creativity with technology. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in
          programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, laying the groundwork for my journey into
          the world of web development. Let's turn ideas into reality!</p><br>
        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends and collaborating
          with other developers. I am also proficient in responsive web design, ensuring that the websites I create
          are accessible and user-friendly across various devices. I believe in continuous learning and am excited
          about the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
